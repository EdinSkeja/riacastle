This is a tool only for those who try their hand at **Functional JavaScript**. To be given this bow you should have delved deep into Michael Fogus' tome "Functional JS", and practice his teachings throughout your app. That often means making heavy use of the functional components of Underscore. Again, this might be overkill for your small application, but to be worthy of the Functional Crossbow, you must do so anyway! Also, your blog posts should feature thoughts on the matter.
