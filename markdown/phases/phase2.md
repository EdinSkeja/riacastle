The rest of the (very very long) day we'll spend fighting the main battle of finishing our app! More details on the [Steg 2](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/ria-utveckling-med-javascript/steg-2-implementering/) page on the course site.

Throughout this battle there should be many opportunities to alert the Guild as to what's going on:

*    [Brag](#training/brag) about your deeds!
*    Issue a formal [thank you](#training/thank) when you receive a pull request
*    Share discovered resources by [adding](#training/addresource) them to the Library
*    [Rate](#training/review) library resources to show what's been useful to you
*    And finally, let us all know when you have [written](#training/write) about your toils!
